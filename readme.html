Summary of the Problem
=================


Create a DSL using ANTLR4 grammar tools to solve an interesting problem. The language should be relatively simple for a domain expert to learn.


Domain
================

Commodities trading.

Defining the Problem & Purpose of the Language
================

Defining the Problem
--------------------------------
There is no programming language with built in tools to analyze commodities prices and predict prices for futures. Languages like Python and R have lots of data analysis tools, but no built-in way to compare a commodity with several factors that could impact its price.\newline

Purpose of the Language
--------------------------------
Our language will mainly be used to answer the following questions:
- What is a fair futures price for a given commodity?
- How do environmental factors impact futures prices for a given commodity?
- Which market futures prices are the furthest off from the user's estimates, and have the highest earning potential.

Example Solutions
================
The following example inputs demonstrate how we would answer the questions above.

~~~~
## EXAMPLE 1 ##
## A user seeks to adjust a variety of files to account for inflation ##
## These files detail commodity prices ##


COMMODITY corn = {inputs/corn.csv}
COMMODITY wheat = {inputs/wheat.csv}
COMMODITY oil = {inputs/oil.csv}
COMMODITY gold = {inputs/gold.csv}

INFL inflation = {inputs/inflation.csv}

commoditiesList = newArray()
commoditiesList.add(corn, wheat, oil, gold)

for c in commoditiesList:
    newFile = c.normalize(inflation)
    newFile.save(outputs/{c + 'Normalized'})

~~~~

~~~~
OUTPUT FOR EXAMPLE 1:

our code would produce 4 output files.
They would be saved to the following locations:
    outputs/cornNormalized
    outputs/wheatNormalized
    outputs/oilNormalized
    outputs/goldNormalized
~~~~


Testing
======================

I used different test cases on all my programs, making them for each specific implementation. I modified it as I went to monitor special cases, and tested a bunch of different possibilities, and did more then 10 for each positive and negative example.

<!--
How do the languages compare to one another?
Which language was your favorite?  Which was your least favorite?
What type of problems would each language be good at solving?
When you had a choice of language, why did you decide on the language in which you implemented your solution?
If you worked with a partnor, how did you decide to split up the work?
