Summary of the Problem
=================


Create a DSL using ANTLR4 grammar tools to solve an interesting problem. The language should be relatively simple for a domain expert to learn.


Domain
================

Commodities trading.

Defining the Problem & Purpose of the Language
================

Defining the Problem
--------------------------------
There is no programming language with built in tools to analyze commodities prices and predict prices for futures. Languages like Python and R have lots of data analysis tools, but no built-in way to compare a commodity with several factors that could impact its price.\newline

Purpose of the Language
--------------------------------
Our language will mainly be used to answer the following questions:
- What is a fair futures price for a given commodity?
- How do environmental factors impact futures prices for a given commodity?
- Which market futures prices are the furthest off from the user's estimates, and have the highest earning potential.

Example Solutions
================
The following example inputs demonstrate how we would answer the questions above.
NOTE, as discussed in class, it does not make sense for us to go through the process of completing all these calculations
So, we've made a couple of files with arbitrary numbers to get our point across in the meantime

~~~~
## EXAMPLE 1 ##
## A user seeks to adjust a variety of files to account for inflation ##
## These files detail commodity prices ##


COMMODITY corn = {inputs/corn.csv}
COMMODITY wheat = {inputs/wheat.csv}
COMMODITY oil = {inputs/oil.csv}
COMMODITY gold = {inputs/gold.csv}

INFL inflation = {inputs/inflation.csv}

commoditiesList = newArray()
commoditiesList.add(corn, wheat, oil, gold)

for c in commoditiesList:
    newFile = c.normalize(inflation)
    newFile.save(outputs/{c + 'Normalized'})

~~~~

~~~~
OUTPUT FOR EXAMPLE 1:

our code would produce 4 output files.
they will still be in the format of year:price
except, the price will be adjusted for inflation
They would be saved to the following locations:
    outputs/cornNormalized
    outputs/wheatNormalized
    outputs/oilNormalized
    outputs/goldNormalized
~~~~

~~~~
## EXAMPLE 2 ##
## A user seeks to predict the futures price for corn based on rainfall rates, for each of the next 10 years ##
## In this case, the FACTOR file 'rain' details rainfall rates in the region of interest ##
## The for loop iterates through years in a 10 year range


COMMODITY corn = {inputs/corn.csv}

FACTOR rainfall = {inputs/rainfall.csv}


for year in range[1, 10]:
    prediction = corn.futures(previousYears = 30, futureYears = year, factor = rainfall)
    print("Year: ", year)
    print("Prediction: ", prediction)

~~~~

~~~~
OUTPUT FOR EXAMPLE 1:

our code will print out 9 values in the terminal (since the for loop has square brackets, it will be INCLUSIVE of 1 and 10).
it will print "Year: {year}", and the next line will print "Prediction: {prediciton}".

see below

-> Year: 1
-> Prediction: 14.6
-> Year: 2
-> Prediction: 14.6
-> Year: 3
-> Prediction: 14.7
-> Year: 4
-> Prediction: 15.8
-> Year: 5
-> Prediction: 13.6
-> Year: 6
-> Prediction: 14.7
-> Year: 7
-> Prediction: 14.6
-> Year: 8
-> Prediction: 14.3
-> Year: 9
-> Prediction: 14.3
-> Year: 10
-> Prediction: 14.4
~~~~

Define Functionality
================

We've laid out the logic / pseudo-code for our language's most important functions below:
~~~~
calculating futures ->
    brief explanation of algorithm/ or just process goes here

normalize to account for inflation ->
    create a new CSV file (or CSV-like datastructure)
    for each year in the old file
        calculate that year's price in today's dollars
        insert it into the new CSV file
    return CSV file

saving datastructure to file path ->
    likely, we'll hold the CSV file as a dictionary or similar object, keyed by {year:value}
    we'll need to write into a file, at the given file path
    for each key in the dictionary
        col1 = year, col2 = value
